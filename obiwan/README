Something I forgot to talk about since I was the Windows guy ;) is
inotify http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify with incrontab
http://inotify.aiken.cz/?section=incron&page=about&lang=en .

In the same way that crontab allows to schedule tasks as time changes,
incrontab allows to schedule tasks when the file system inodes (hence
the name) change. You can use it to update indexes when a file is
added in a folder for example or anything that is recurrent and file
based in your workflow.
